# scary-maze
A python remake of the classic scary maze browser game.

## About

You might remember the old [scary-maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=469zNXTCHdk) by Jeremy Winterrowd, released in 2003. This is a pygame-based remake, including new assets and a handmade soundtrack by [Hans Lilljekvist](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackbirdmusix). I wrote this for an pygame tutorial series on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0faHRYVxDn7chW573SSh8A).

## Setup and Usage

1. Download all files. 
2. Run `python3 game.py`. 
3. Enjoy!
